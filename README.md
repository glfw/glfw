# GLFW

## Introduction

GLFW is a free, Open Source, portable library for OpenGL and OpenGL ES
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows and contexts, reading input, handling events, etc.

Version 3.1 is *not yet described*.

If you are new to GLFW, you may find the
[introductory tutorial](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) for GLFW
3 useful.  If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a
[transition guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html) for moving to
the GLFW 3 API.


## Compiling GLFW

See the [Compiling GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) guide in
the GLFW documentation.


## Using GLFW

See the
[Building programs that use GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide in the GLFW documentation.


## Dependencies

GLFW bundles a number of dependencies in the `deps/` directory.

The following dependencies are needed by GLFW:

 - [Khronos extension headers](https://www.opengl.org/registry/)

The following dependencies are needed by the examples and test programs:

 - [getopt\_port](https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/) for getopt
 - [TinyCThread](https://gitorious.org/tinythread/tinycthread/) for threading
 - An OpenGL loader generated by [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)


## Changelog

 - Added native monitor handle access to native API
 - Added `glfwSetDropCallback` and `GLFWdropfun` for receiving dropped files
 - [Cocoa] Bugfix: Using a 1x1 cursor for hidden mode caused some screen
                   recorders to fail
 - [Win32] Bugfix: Failure to load winmm or its functions was not reported to
                   the error callback
 - [X11] Bugfix: The case of finding no usable CRTCs was not detected
 - [X11] Bugfix: Detection of broken Nvidia RandR gamma support did not verify
                 that at least one CRTC was present


## Contact

The official website for GLFW is [glfw.org](http://www.glfw.org/).  There you
can find the latest version of GLFW, as well as news, documentation and other
information about the project.

If you have questions related to the use of GLFW, we have a
[support forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/glfw/discussion/247562/), and the IRC
channel `#glfw` on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).

If you have a bug to report, a patch to submit or a feature you'd like to
request, please file it in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues) on GitHub.

Finally, if you're interested in helping out with the development of GLFW or
porting it to your favorite platform, we have an occasionally active
[developer's mailing list](https://lists.stacken.kth.se/mailman/listinfo/glfw-dev),
or you could join us on `#glfw`.
