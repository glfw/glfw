## Introduction

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

GLFW is licensed under the [zlib/libpng
license](http://www.glfw.org/license.html).

The latest stable release is version 3.2.1.

See the [downloads](http://www.glfw.org/download.html) page for details and
files, or fetch the `latest` branch, which always points to the latest stable
release.  Each release starting with 3.0 also has a corresponding [annotated
tag](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases) with source and binary archives.
The [version history](http://www.glfw.org/changelog.html) lists all user-visible
changes for every release.

This is a development branch for version 3.3, which is _not yet described_.

If you are new to GLFW, you may find the
[tutorial](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) for GLFW
3 useful.  If you have used GLFW 2 in the past, there is a
[transition guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/moving.html) for moving to
the GLFW 3 API.


## Compiling GLFW

GLFW itself requires only the headers and libraries for your window system.  It
does not need the headers for any context creation API (WGL, GLX, EGL, NSGL) or
rendering API (OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan) to enable support for them.

GLFW supports compilation on Windows with Visual C++ 2010 and later, MinGW and
MinGW-w64, on macOS with Clang and on Linux and other Unix-like systems with GCC
and Clang.  It will likely compile in other environments as well, but this is
not regularly tested.

There are also [pre-compiled Windows
binaries](http://www.glfw.org/download.html) available for all compilers
supported on that platform.

See the [compilation guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) in the
documentation for more information.


## Using GLFW

See the [building application guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/build.html)
guide in the documentation for more information.


## System requirements

GLFW supports Windows XP and later, OS X 10.7 Lion and later, and Linux and
other Unix-like systems with the X Window System.  Experimental implementations
for the Wayland protocol and the Mir display server are available but not yet
officially supported.

See the [compatibility guide](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html)
in the documentation for more information.


## Dependencies

GLFW itself depends only on the headers and libraries for your window system.

The examples and test programs depend on a number of tiny libraries.  These are
located in the `deps/` directory.

 - [getopt\_port](https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/) for examples
   with command-line options
 - [TinyCThread](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread) for threaded
   examples
 - An OpenGL 3.2 core loader generated by
   [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for examples using modern OpenGL
 - [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) for linear algebra in
   examples
 - [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear) for test and example UI
 - [stb\_image\_write](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for writing images to disk
 - [Vulkan headers](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/) for Vulkan tests

The Vulkan example additionally requires the Vulkan SDK to be installed, or it
will not be included in the build.

The documentation is generated with [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/).  If CMake
does not find Doxygen, the documentation will not be generated when you build.


## Reporting bugs

Bugs are reported to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues).
Please check the [contribution
guide](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for
information on what to include when reporting a bug.
